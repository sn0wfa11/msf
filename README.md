# sn0wfa11's Collection of Personal Metasploit Modules, Plugins, and Modifications

This repository contains many of my Metasploit modules, plugins, and personal modifications. 

They are included here for various reasons:
- Testing in preperation for submission to the Metasploit-Framework Project
- Is outside of the requirements for submission to the MSF Project. (ie. Modules that call other modules.)
- Is my own take on a module that is already in the framework.



This repository is under initial construciton. I will be adding things shortly, along with instructions.

Look for my Overwatch MSF plugin first ;)
